# To do app [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is just a client classic 'to do' app, because I didn't have one on my history.

The aim of this little project was to try and practice with:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), as static site generator.
- [Material-ui](https://material-ui.com), as UI framework.
- [React Context](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
